# YOUR BUDDY
# A game by WAYWARD FORGE

This is a game about a guy and his dog. Aside from some free art and music assets made by the
awesome people listed below, I made this by myself in a week and a half for The Programmer's 
Hangout 2021 Game Jam.

The game features an "overworld"-type area with exploration and puzzles, as well as an action sequence.
It only supports 1366x768 resolution right now.

To-do list, in order of some mixture of importance and difficulty:
- Make separate day scenes in overworld
- Create and finish finale scene
- Create and finish name entry scene

Nice-to-haves:
- Figure out what, if anything, I want to do with the dog's "waypoint" assistance behavior
- New enemy that shoots projectiles in the action scene
- Provide cooldown meters in the action scene
- More animations and sound effects
- Add Herobrine
