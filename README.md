# YOUR BUDDY
# A game by WAYWARD FORGE

This is a game about a guy and his dog. Aside from some free art and music assets made by the
awesome people listed in the credits, I made this by myself in a week and a half for The Programmer's 
Hangout 2021 Game Jam.

The game features an "overworld"-type area with exploration and puzzles, as well as an action sequence.
It only supports 1366x768 resolution right now.
